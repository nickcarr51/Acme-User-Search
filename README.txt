--Notes--

- search works by typing and hitting enter, saves the input value in the hash so the page can be refreshed with same results

- if a search results more than 50 users, arrow buttons are generated to scroll through pages, they only exist on the page when there are > 50users

- wasn't sure how to troubleshoot but it seems like the /search endpoint does not actually search titles (just names and emails)

- while the page does save search results on refresh, if it's multiple pages, it always refreshes to first page of results (might try and fix this another time!)
